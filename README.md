# Purpose
A personal portfolio website using Github Pages ( too broke for hosting :/ ) to showcase my projects, skills, and experience.

### TODO soon.
* For technical skills, add grid of icons when screen is large.
* Add icons to teck stack part of each project.
* If necessary, make the other section about your interests, hobbies, etc.
* For the other section, anything you would like to mention would be it's own page (similar to resources section, where it links to another page). For example it would be Interests: click here (links to new html page for interests).
